Bean Definition Inheritance
1) parent attribute to the base bean
2) merge attribute to the collection property of base bean
3) abstract attribute to the parent bean to not create object of parent bean
Advantage:
	Improve performance

We have lot of bean definition in xml. let's something common in all bean.
By Inheritance,
	We can have one bean which contains all these common definition inside it and then inherit it from other beans.
	Now this parent bean which have common definitions that can be a bean it self or 
		it can be abstract(that mean there are no beans created for it). 
	all it does as the purpose of template your bean definitions. 

We need to create child bean definitions and parent bean definitions.

There are some attributes used in "Bean Definition Inheritance".
	(1) parent attribute (added to the child)
	(2) merge attribute (added to the child)
	(3) abstract attribute (added to the parent)

(1) parent attribute (added to the child)
In XML file:
	1.Define a parent bean
		<bean id="parentTriangle" class="">
			<property name="pointA" ref="pointA"></property>
		</bean>
	2.Define child bean and inherit parent property using "parent attribute"
		<bean id="triangle1" class="" parent="parentTriangle">
			<property name="pointB" ref="pointB"></property>
			<property name="pointC" ref="pointC"></property>
		</bean>		In this bean, pointA automatically inherited from parent bean that is "parentTriangle".
Example: com.kumari.khusi._13beanDefinitionInheritance._1parentAttribute

(2) merge attribute (added to the child)
In XML file:
	1.parent bean with <list>
		<bean id="parentTriangle" class="">
			<property name="points">
				<list><ref bean="pointA" /></list>
			</property></bean>
	2.child bean, inherit parent list property using "merge attribute" and "parent attribute"
		<bean id="triangle2" class="" parent="parentTriangle">
			<property name="points">
				<list merge="true"><ref bean="pointA" /></list>
			</property>
		</bean>
Example: com.kumari.khusi._13beanDefinitionInheritance._2mergeAttribute

(3) abstract attribute (added to the parent)
In XML file:
	1.parent bean with <list> and "abstract attribute"
		<bean id="parentTriangle" class="" abstract="true">
			<property name="points">
				<list><ref bean="pointA" /></list>
			</property></bean>
	2.child bean, inherit parent list property using "merge attribute" and "parent attribute"
		<bean id="triangle2" class="" parent="parentTriangle">
			<property name="points">
				<list merge="true"><ref bean="pointA" /></list>
			</property>
		</bean>
Here parent bean will not create because of "abstract attribute", this bean is written only for template purpose i.e. 
	we need some defined functionality and don't want to create parent bean.
