JSR-250 Annotations:
Java Specification Standard annotation
	JSR-250 annotations Which are applied for different technologies and different frameworks
	JSR-250 is a Java Specification Request with the objective 
		to develop annotations for common semantic concepts in the Java SE and Java EE platforms 
	The JSR 250 specification includes annotations for injecting a resource into an end-point implementation class, 
		and for managing application life-cycle. 

@Resource Annotation
	Standard dependency injection by name. 
@Resource :byName
@Resource(name="pointC"):byName


If we are writing our own init() & destroy() method, then mention annotation just above methods as:  
	@PostConstruct & 
	@PreDestroy
	and write registerShutDownHook() in "TestSpringProject.java".






Stereotype Annotations: 
	Specify what role is bean doing. 

@Component
	For model classes like Employee, Model
@Controller
	To get request and give response
@Service
	Called from controllern for business logic
@Repository
	Call from Service for Database operations

<context:component-scan base-package="com.asd.className"/>
<context:component-scan base-package="com.asd.*"/>

If we want many bean of one type then we have to use XML configuration.
