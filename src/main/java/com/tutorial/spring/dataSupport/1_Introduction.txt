Database Setting Up

Apache Derby
It is very lightweight in memory database. 
It is very easy to setup and takes less resources.
It's perfect for testing out new concept(so that using "Derby" database).
(bin contains program to start and stop database.
"lib" contains jars that we have to include.)

Setup database derby
	(1) Download derby zip file
	(2) Set environment variables
			DERBY_HOME
			PATH till bin
	(3) Start Derby database
			(1) In network server mode	
				1. Start server
