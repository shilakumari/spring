Interceptor
Many times on internet, if you want to access some website, some time won't get requested web page.
Instead of that getting some message on response page like - "the website is not working at the moment, please try after sometimes".
To perform above activity, we used "Interceptor".

Steps to instruct spring MVC to perform some task before handling a request:
(1) Include a java class:
	extends "HandlerInterceptorAdapter" class and override one of it's methods with name "preHandle".
(2) Write the code in the preHandle() method:
	which you want Spring MVC to execute before handling the request.
(3) Put an entry of this newly added java class:
	in the Spring configuration file.




(1) Include a java class
preHandle():
	If this method returns true then, Application will further handle the request.
	If this method returns false then, Application will not further handle the request.
		Example:
			This Application should work on all week days except for Sunday.
			If we are accessing on Sunday then should have to show an error -
			(The website does not work on Sunday; please try accessing it on any other week day!!)
	After receiving the request, The application first made a call to "preHandle method".

postHandle():
	// This method would be called after Spring MVC executes the request handler method for the request
	

afterCompletion():
		// This method would be called after the response object is produced by the view request


if we want to made a call to specific uRL request only then inside <mvc:interceptor> add:
	<mvc:mapping path="/admissionForm.html"/>
	Example:
		<mvc:interceptor>
			<mvc:mapping path="/admissionForm.html"/>
				<bean class=""/>
		</mvc:interceptor>


public class DayOfWeekBasedAccessInterceptor extends HandlerInterceptorAdapter {
public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler)throws IOException {
	Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
	int dayOfWeek = cal.get(cal.DAY_OF_WEEK);// getting the on which request is made	
	if (dayOfWeek == 1) {// 1 means Sunday, 2 means Monday,..., 7 means Saturday
		response.getWriter().write("The website is closed on sunday, please try again accessing it on any other week day!!");
		return false;
	}		
	return true;// if this method returns true then, Application will further handle the request.
}}
public void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler,
			ModelAndView modelAndView) throws IOException {
		// This method would be called after Spring MVC executes the request handler method for the request
		System.out.println("HendlerInterceptorAdeptor: Spring MVC called postHandle() method for "
				+ request.getRequestURI().toString());
}

public void afterComletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, Exception ex)
			throws IOException {
		// This method would be called after the response object is produced by the view request
		System.out.println("HendlerInterceptorAdeptor: Spring MVC called afterComletion() method for "
				+ request.getRequestURI().toString());
}

2)
<mvc:interceptors>
		<bean class="com.demo._4Interceptor.DayOfWeekBasedAccessInterceptor" />
		<mvc:interceptor>
			<mvc:mapping path="/interceptorFormValidation/admissionForm5.html" />
			<bean class="com.demo._4Interceptor.DayOfWeekBasedAccessInterceptor2" />
		</mvc:interceptor>

		<bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.i18n.LocaleChangeInterceptor">
			<property name="paramName" value="siteLanguage" />
		</bean>
	</mvc:interceptors>



Normally fiters are called before interceptors.
